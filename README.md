## About the Lanthanum Mod

Welcome to the Lanthanum Mod! This mod is inspired by my fondness for the Chinese character "镧" (Lanthanum).

### Why Create This Mod?

The reason I created this mod initially was simply because I liked the Chinese character "镧" (Lanthanum).<br/>
"澜" is a character from the game "Arena Of Valor."<br/>
Later, it also incorporates my fondness for [**IndustrialCraft2**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/industrial-craft) and [**Mekanism**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mekanism).

## Lanthanum Mod - Mod Overview

- **New Dimension**: The mod introduces a new dimension, Dimension #14, completely removing rivers and oceans, filling the dimension with Lanthanum blocks.

- **New Ores and Weapons**: Lanthanum ore and gemstone ore are introduced along with their derivatives and powerful weapons.

- **Lanthanum Portal**: The mod adds a Lanthanum-made portal frame for portal creation. Now, you can create portals similar to Nether portals using the portal frame and water.

- **Energy System**: The mod seamlessly integrates with the RebornCore mod, introducing a robust energy system. To fully unleash the mod's potential, [**Reborn Core**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/reborncore) is now a mandatory prerequisite.

- **Mod Compatibility**: With RebornCore providing a stable energy framework, compatibility is ensured with the generators and energy transmission mechanisms of the [**TechReborn**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/techreborn) mod.

- **Refiner Functionality**: The Refiner can now yield double output for Lanthanum and gemstone ores. It can be powered continuously with redstone or other compatible generators from different mods, providing a more flexible and efficient refining process.

The Lanthanum mod is an excellent tech-oriented addition. Feel free to provide feedback, suggestions, or apply to become a contributor to further enhance and contribute to this project.

## Lanthanum Mod - Goals

- **More Ores**: Lanthanum plans to offer up to 64 times ore multiplication in the future, sounding ambitious, but it requires more energy for operations.

## Lanthanum Mod - Dependencies and Collaborations

### Dependencies
- [**Reborn Core**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/reborncore): The mod seamlessly integrates with RebornCore, introducing a powerful energy system.

### Collaborations
